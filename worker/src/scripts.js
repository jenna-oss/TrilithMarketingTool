 * /scripts/* — scripts for solo talking-head videos.
 *
 * A planned slot can go two ways: Render, which has the pipeline make a video
 * and speak over it, or this, which writes what you say to camera. The words
 * are the whole product here, so they go through the same two checks the
 * pipeline's Script stage runs — the brand-voice lint and the beginner
 * listener — and what those say is kept on the script for the page to show.
 *
 * Writing to camera is not narration with a face on it. Narration is read over
 * pictures that carry half the meaning; here there are no pictures, so the
 * lines carry all of it, they are shorter, and they sound like someone talking
 * rather than someone reading. The prompt below is the only place that
 * difference lives.
 *
 * Only a signed-in person on the app's list reaches any of this: index.js
 * gates every route but /auth/*.

HOW THIS CHANNEL TALKS

The channel is about what owning property does to someone's life — the income that arrives whether or not
they worked that month, the job they could leave, the house their family lives in. Every video leads with
that and explains the mechanics only as far as needed to make the life believable. It is never a lesson.

- Name the money in the first line, every time. A figure, a rent, a monthly number: something countable.
- Lead with the life the money buys, then how it was done. Never the other way round.
- Every idea has to support the same thing: that buying property is how the money grows.
- Say it the way you would to a friend who has never bought a property. No acronym, no term of art, and no
  figure goes by without plain words next to it, in the same breath.
- Short lines. Eight to fourteen words is the shape. Never more than eighteen — at twenty-two a line is read
  at twice the pace of a short one, and the whole thing sounds uneven.
- Confident, not excited. No exclamation marks, no hype words, nothing certain about the future, no
  guarantees. Never say Trilith; the channel is The Buy Box.
- ${TARGET_WORDS[0]} to ${TARGET_WORDS[1]} words in total, across at most ${MAX_SCRIPT_LINES} lines. That is
  about a minute of talking.
- The last line asks the viewer to follow. Say follow, in those words.

TO CAMERA, NOT OVER PICTURES

There is nothing on screen but a person. So:
- Every line has to stand up spoken aloud. Read each one in your head; if it only works written down, rewrite it.
- No line may describe something the viewer would have to see. Nothing is being shown.
- Contractions, plain verbs, and the odd sentence fragment. Written-down grammar sounds stiff out loud.
- One thought per line. Someone reading this to camera takes a breath between them.

Return the script with the script tool, one line per beat.`;
