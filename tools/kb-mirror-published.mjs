/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Mirror Trilith's published website content into kb.published_content.
 *
 * The content schema already holds 80 pages split into 561 passages, and it
 * answers "what has Trilith written about X" well. It cannot answer "have we
 * already made this argument", because it records no topic, angle or hook —
 * those are the fields repetition detection compares, and a web page does not
 * state them anywhere a parser could read.
 *
 * So they are derived. Each page is read once by the model, which returns the
 * topic, the angle, and the opening hook as the page itself states them. The
 * derivation is marked in metadata as inferred, because it is: nobody at
 * Trilith wrote "angle: lower rates don't mean cheaper homes" on that post.
 *
 * The two tables are not redundant. This one is deliberately shallow — one row
 * per piece, no body — because repetition detection compares arguments, not
 * paragraphs.
 *
 * Needs SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY and ANTHROPIC_API_KEY.
 * VOYAGE_API_KEY is optional but strongly wanted: without an embedding,
 * repetition detection falls back to trigram matching on topic and angle, which
 * catches an exact restatement and misses a paraphrase.

topic  — the subject, as a short noun phrase. "DSCR loans", "appraisal gaps".
angle  — the specific argument the piece makes about that topic. Not a summary
         of the whole article: the claim that makes this piece different from
         every other piece on the same topic. One sentence.
hook   — the opening line or the first claim the piece leads with, quoted from
         the text where there is one to quote. Null if the piece opens with
         nothing quotable.

Rules:
- Use only what the article actually says. Do not infer a claim it does not make.
- If the piece makes no distinct argument — a product page, an FAQ — set angle
  to null rather than inventing one.
- hook must be verbatim from the text, or null. Never paraphrase into it.

Return bare JSON, no prose, no code fence:
{"results":[{"url":"...","topic":"...","angle":"..."|null,"hook":"..."|null}]}`;
