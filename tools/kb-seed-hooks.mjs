 * Build the hook library from the Spyglass hook patterns (spec section 20).
 *
 * adspy.hook_patterns holds 833 creative structures from seven advertisers
 * OUTSIDE the lending category — NerdWallet, Chime, Zillow, LendingTree, Rocket
 * Money, Hormozi, Kiyosaki. Spyglass has no insight coverage for investor
 * lenders at all, so none of it is competitor intelligence, and the planner is
 * told so in two places: the system prompt, and the origin field on every row
 * this writes.
 *
 * What those rows are is labels — "Personal discovery narrative (I [found] a
 * [sign])". What section 20 asks for is a template and an example. Turning one
 * into the other is a rewrite into the lending context, which is why this needs
 * a model and is a separate, occasional job rather than part of the daily run.
 *
 * Needs SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY and ANTHROPIC_API_KEY.

const SYSTEM = `You adapt advertising hook patterns into reusable templates for a private real estate lender that finances property investors — fix-and-flip, bridge, DSCR, ground-up, BRRRR, multifamily. The audience is investors and the brokers who serve them.

You are given patterns observed on brands OUTSIDE lending: consumer finance, real estate marketplaces, business education. You are taking the FORM, not the content. Never write a template that claims anything about a competitor.

For each pattern return:

category — a short snake_case family name. Reuse these where they fit:
           myth_busting, cost_of_waiting, contrarian, personal_discovery,
           speed_or_ease, hidden_cost, qualification, comparison,
           objection_handling, proof_or_receipts, warning, question_open
template — the reusable shape, with {placeholders} for the parts that change.
           It must read as a spoken opening line for a 30-60 second vertical
           video, not as a headline or a banner.
example  — the template filled in for this lender, on a real subject like DSCR
           qualification, appraisal gaps, rehab draws, or the cost of waiting
           for rates. One sentence, natural spoken English.
topics   — up to 3 lending subjects this shape suits.

Drop a pattern rather than force it. If a pattern is specific to the source
brand's product — a checking account bonus, a subscription canceller, an
astrology skit — return "skip": true for it and nothing else. A padded library
is worse than a short one: every row here is something a planner may put in
front of a lender's audience.

Return bare JSON, no prose, no code fence:
{"hooks":[{"pattern_ref":"...","skip":false,"category":"...","template":"...","example":"...","topics":["..."]}]}`;
