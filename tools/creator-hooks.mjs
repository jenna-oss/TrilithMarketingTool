/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Rebuild the creators-page hook library from whatever was harvested today.
 *
 * Why this is not a Spyglass call, unlike the briefing's hook patterns:
 * Spyglass's HOOK/USP insight aggregation returns empty for these creators.
 * It is tuned to paid campaigns, and these are organic posts. The patterns on
 * this page were mined by hand for that reason; this reproduces that reading
 * on every run instead of freezing it at one research pass.
 *
 * Only genuine spoken openings are mined. pull-creators.mjs marks a card's
 * text hookSource:'title' when Spyglass returned no hook and the caption's
 * first line was used for display instead. A caption headline is not a spoken
 * opening, and clustering it as one would put patterns in the library that
 * nobody ever said out loud.
 *
 * Needs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY. Skips itself, without failing, when it is absent —
 * the page keeps yesterday's library, which is stale but true.

const SYSTEM = `You name the recurring FORMS of opening lines in short-form educational video, for an internal creative reference page.

You are given real hooks, each with the creator who said it. Group them by the SHAPE of the opening — what the line does to earn the next five seconds — not by topic. "Two hooks about DSCR loans" is not a pattern; "two hooks that open by naming a loan program most buyers do not know exists" is.

Rules:
- A pattern needs at least two DIFFERENT creators using it independently. Include a single-creator pattern only when the form is genuinely distinctive, and it will be labelled "single example" on the page.
- Quote examples EXACTLY as given. Never paraphrase, never invent a hook.
- Attribute every example to the creator who actually said it.
- Prefer 8 to 14 patterns. Do not force every hook into one; leave the unremarkable ones out.
- label: 4 to 7 words, plain, no jargon and no title case.
- description: one or two sentences on what the form does and why it earns attention. Describe the mechanism, not the topic.
