 * own standard for a hook: sharp, declarative, a little confrontational, with
 * a number in it where there is one. "This deal made four thousand dollars. It
 * took eleven months." Not "You won't BELIEVE what happened."
 *
 * It is allowed to come back with nothing. Most takes have two or three
 * moments like that in them and a pile of perfectly good talking that does not
 * open anything, and forcing five clips out of a take that holds two is how
 * you end up posting the weak three.
 *
 * The model picks whole sentences by number rather than timestamps, so a cut
 * always lands on a sentence boundary that really exists in the take.

  return `Below is everything said in one long take to camera, one sentence per line, numbered, with how
long each lasts. It is a real estate investor talking about lending and deals, for The Buy Box
(@thebuyboxre), a channel for people who want to own property.

Your job is to find the passages worth cutting out as short videos. A short is watched or skipped on its
first sentence, so a passage only counts if the sentence it OPENS on works as a hook on its own.

What that channel's hook sounds like — sharp, declarative, a little confrontational, and specific:
  Yes: "This deal made four thousand dollars. It took eleven months."
  Yes: "185 purchase, 60 rehab, comps at 340."
  No:  "You won't believe what happened with this flip."
  No:  "So anyway, as I was saying about points..."
  No:  "Obviously you'll want to weigh points against rate."

So an opening sentence is good when it names something countable, or states a position plainly enough
that someone would stay to hear why. It is bad when it depends on what came before it, when it is hype,
when it talks down, or when it is certain about the future.

Each clip also has to stand on its own: a whole thought, beginning to end, not a fragment of an argument
that only makes sense with the rest of the take around it. It should last between ${MIN_S} and ${MAX_S}
seconds.

Take as many as the take really holds and no more. Most takes hold two or three. If this one holds
nothing — nobody opens anything cleanly — come back with an empty list and say so. An empty list is a
perfectly good answer and much better than a weak clip.

Clips must not overlap.

${lines}

Report with the clips tool: the sentence it opens on, the sentence it ends on, and one line on what makes
that opening worth opening on.`;
