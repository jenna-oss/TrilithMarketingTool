month they stop trading hours for money, the trip they didn't have to save two years for. Open there, then teach
the one thing that gets them closer. The lesson stays; the lecture goes.
- Beats 1 to 3 are about the life, not the mechanics, and they say where it comes from: doing this is how the
  money gets made. Name something concrete a person can picture, in their words, not a category ("two flips a
  year is the deposit on the house you actually want", not "portfolio diversification"), and tie it to the
  method in the same breath. No definitions in them, and no acronyms.
- The spine of every video is the route: this is how people build real money in property, here is the one
  thing that decides whether you get it, and that is what pays for the life. State the route plainly once, in
  the viewer's words. A video that only teaches a mechanism, or only warns about one, has missed the point.
- From beat 4 the video earns it: the one idea that gets them there, in plain words, built to the takeaway, and
  each mechanical beat says what it does for them, not only how it works.
- At most three beats carry a figure, spelled out or not ("ten percent" counts), and at most two acronyms
  appear in the whole script. Better still, drop
  the term: say what it does in plain words, and name it only when the video is about the term itself. Scripts
  that read as a string of ratios and acronyms are the thing being fixed here.
- The takeaway says what this builds for them -- the money, the next deal, the life it pays for -- not what a
  term means and not only what to avoid.
- The loss case earns one beat at most, and the beat after it says what the gain is when you get it right.
  Never leave the last word with the downside.
- Every video makes the same case: investing in property builds wealth. Say it plainly, and back it with the
  figures the research gave you -- what the deal earns, keeps or is worth in five years. A video about a fee, a
  mistake or a risk makes the case by showing how to keep the gain, never by leaving the impression the thing
  is not worth doing.
- Still the brand voice: no hype, no promises about the future, no "get rich". The life is shown as what the
  math makes possible, and the math is why it's believable.`

  text is the one exception.) Give each piece of text its own clear area and keep graphics out of it with at least
  24px to spare. In a chart or diagram, place the labels first and fit the lines around them: a label for a point
  sits beside the point, never where a line ends or passes, and a line that rises to a value stops short of that
  value's label. Every scene's frames are checked for this after the render.`

// The Buy Box brand guide's look, for the stages that design scenes. Rules,
// never layouts: there is no component library, so every scene is designed
// from scratch and the videos keep their variety.
const BRAND_LOOK = `THE LOOK: The Buy Box brand guide. Every value lives in ${REMOTION_ROOT}/src/brand.ts; import it, never hard-code it.
- Surfaces: BLACK or WHITE, full-bleed; CONCRETE for panels on white; GRAPHITE for small labels and rules. Extremely
  high contrast is the point.
- Accents carry meaning. ORANGE (Site Orange) marks the one thing to look at in a scene: the problem, the cost, the
  key word or number. GREEN (Pencil) marks the answer: fundable, the fix, "after". One accent colour per scene at
  most, and green only for an answer.
- Type: HEAD (Archivo, weight 800-900) for every headline and number; BODY (Inter, weight 500-700) for labels. Go
  big: headlines at least MIN_HEADLINE (110px), key numbers 220-420px, nothing below MIN_TEXT (40px). At most six
  words of headline on screen at once. Sentence case, ending in a period: declarative, like the voice.
- The guide's headline box: a line of Archivo in a tight BLACK box with WHITE text, the key line in an ORANGE box,
  one box per line, stacked. Use it where a statement should hit, especially over footage.
- Shapes: square corners, thick solid bars, flat colour. No gradients, shadows, rounded corners, cream or navy.
- Safe zone: aim to put every scene's text inside <SafeArea> (from ./brand), the part of the frame inside
  Instagram's safe zone and above the captions. Absolute offsets inside it are relative to it, so bottom: 0 sits
  just above the captions. Full-bleed backgrounds and footage go outside it. When a scene needs a little more room
  to keep its text from overlapping, text may go up to SAFE_SLACK (40px) past the safe zone's top, left or right
  edge, or dip below SafeArea's bottom, but never lower than CAPTION_TOP: below that it hits the captions, and
  below the safe zone it sits under Instagram's own controls.
- Alignment: centred by default. Centre a scene's text both ways inside <SafeArea> (it is a flex column: set
  alignItems: "center" and justifyContent: "center", and textAlign: "center" on text that wraps) rather than
  starting it at the top-left. Left-aligned text is the exception, used in at most two scenes where a list or a
  stack reads better that way, and where footage needs the text kept off the subject.
${NO_OVERLAP}
- Motion: quick and sure. Boxes and lines slide in on a short stagger, numbers count up, things stop hard. No
  wobble, bounce or flash.`

const VARIETY = `VARIETY: there is no component library. Design every scene from scratch for its own line, and make them
differ: composition (a number filling the frame, a stack of headline boxes, a split screen, a list that builds, a
simple diagram, one word alone), scale and motion should all change from scene to scene. Vary those, not the
alignment: text stays centred, as THE LOOK says, apart from its few exceptions. Don't repeat a layout within the
video, and don't copy one from this account's older videos.`

gaps. Cross-check facts against 2-3 sources when possible. Extract dated, specific facts with citations
-- do not invent numbers. If the topic doesn't have hard figures (rates, ratios, dollar amounts), say so

a figure, confirm it from a source, or say in missingNumbers that it could not be confirmed.

never speak as a lender or pitch a product ("we fund", "our rates", "ours means"). Some briefs and sources
still carry a lender's name or products from before the channel launched: keep the idea, drop the name.
These videos build the channel; their only ask is to follow it.

WHO IS TALKING: the person on the other side of the underwriting desk, who wants your deal to work and
will tell you plainly when it doesn't. They have been deep in hundreds of deals, the good, the bad and the
ugly, and it has not made them arrogant toward investors at the start of their journey. They are patient,
and use deep expertise to turn complex ideas into simple lessons for beginners.

VOICE (fixed, whatever the topic): an experienced real estate investor-operator. Confident, backed by
data, to the point. Credibility over reach.
- We are: experienced, beginner friendly, confident about the math.
- We are not: superior, dumbed down, certain about the future.
So: no hype, no talking down ("obviously", "everyone knows"), and no promises or predictions. Say what
the numbers show, not what will happen.

TONE (depends on the beat):
- Hook: sharp, declarative, a little confrontational.
  Say this: "This deal made four thousand dollars. It took eleven months."
  Not this: "You won't BELIEVE what happened with this flip."
- Deal breakdown: neutral; let the numbers carry it.
  Say this: "185 purchase, 60 rehab, comps at 340. That is 72% all-in on ARV, with about 15k of room."
  Not this: "The numbers on this one are absolutely incredible."
- Beginner explainer: patient and plain.
  Say this: "Points are prepaid interest. Two points on 300k is 6,000 at closing, and it buys down your rate."
  Not this: "Obviously you'll want to weigh points against rate."
The examples set the register, not a licence for jargon: terms like ARV and comps still get explained the

and come away having learned something real, with no background at all. People who already invest
should still find it worth watching: clear, not dumbed down.
- Prefer the plain words to the term: "rent divided by the payment" beats naming the ratio, and a video
  that never says the acronym is usually the clearer one. Name a term only where the video is about it, or
  where they will meet it on a lender's page and need it.
- Any term you do use is explained in plain words the first time it comes up, in that beat or the very next
  one. The key terms above come with plain meanings; use them. Never use a term before it has been
  explained, except in a locked opening line, which stays as written; if that line uses jargon, beat 2
  unpacks it.
- For an acronym, say once what the letters stand for and what it means in everyday terms.
- One idea per beat. Short sentences. Everyday words. Give every number its meaning ("$4,500 a month
  in rent", not "four-point-five gross").
- No insider slang ("pencil out", "BRRRR", "LTC", "points", "comp factors") unless you explain it.
- Build to ONE clear takeaway a beginner could repeat to a friend. Say it plainly near the end, and
  report it as takeaway.`

${VARIETY}

For each beat give:
- idea: this scene's own visual idea -- what is on screen and how it moves, specific to its line (e.g. "0.83
  fills the frame in Archivo, an orange bar wipes in under it, 'rent divided by the payment' types in below").
- background: black, white, concrete, footage (a real video clip behind the text), or photo (one of the
  channel's own photographs in a black frame, with the scene's words straddling one of its edges -- see THE
  LOOK); with photo, also give its file name in the "photo" field and say in the idea whether the picture sits
  high with the words across its bottom edge or low with the words across its top edge.
- accent: orange for the one thing to look at, green only when the beat is the answer or the fix, or none;
  accentOn: the word or number it goes on.
- needsAsset, and if true assetSearchHint: 2-3 keyword phrases for a Pexels VIDEO search specific to THIS
  beat's line (not a generic topic keyword).

HARD RULES (a plan that breaks these is rejected and you'll be asked again):
1. No two beats in a row share a background.
2. background is "footage" exactly when needsAsset is true. Aim for two or three footage beats: not zero, not
   most of them. A photo beat never needs an asset: needsAsset is false.
2a. Beat 1's background is "photo", with a photo named from the library below: the opening shows the life this is
   about. Up to two more beats in the first half may use a photo, each a different file, and never two photo
   beats in a row.
3. The last beat is the closing frame (the logo, the takeaway, "Follow @thebuyboxre"); its background is black
   or white.
4. At least one beat uses orange.
5. One entry per beat, in order.

1. Search Pexels' VIDEO endpoint ONLY (e.g. https://www.pexels.com/search/videos/<query>/) -- never photos, never GIFs.
   Get 3-5 candidate direct .mp4 URLs (use WebFetch on the video page to find the videos.pexels.com/video-files/ direct link).
2. For each candidate in order, download it with curl (User-Agent header needed) to a temp location, then:
   a. TIER 1 (free, no judgment needed): extract 3 frames via ffmpeg (start/mid/end, e.g. -ss 0, -ss <dur/2>, -ss <dur-0.5>).
      Look at the 3 frames yourself -- if they look nearly identical (static/boring shot, nothing moving), reject this
      candidate immediately and move to the next one without further analysis.
   b. TIER 2 (your judgment on the 3 frames): decide three things --
      - relevant: would a viewer immediately connect this footage to the EXACT beat line above? Generic topic-adjacent
        stock (e.g. handshake footage for any finance beat) should FAIL this even if thematically nearby.
      - visuallyInteresting: real composition/lighting, not the generic locked-off corporate-stock look, no dead space,
        no burned-in watermark or logo.
      - verticalCropOK: would a 9:16 COVER crop (filling the frame, cropping edges) cut off or squeeze out the
        interesting content? This does NOT gate approval -- it only decides the render mode.
   c. If relevant && visuallyInteresting: this candidate is APPROVED. Move it to
      ${REMOTION_ROOT}/public/${research.slug}/beat_${beat.order}.mp4 (create the folder if needed) and stop.
      Report cropMode as "cover" if verticalCropOK else "contain-white".
   d. If relevant is false OR visuallyInteresting is false, reject and try the next candidate. Up to 4 total attempts.
3. If all attempts fail, report approved: false and do not download anything -- this beat will fall back to a
   graphic-only treatment, which is the correct outcome, not a failure to fix.

Footage plays full-bleed with <OffthreadVideo> for cropMode "cover", or contained (object-fit: contain) on BLACK
or WHITE for "contain-white", with the scene's text over it in the guide's headline boxes.

A "photo" beat is one of the channel's own photographs in a black frame, with the scene's words straddling one
of its edges. On a BLACK background, with PHOTO_FRAME from ./brand and "const F = PHOTO_FRAME.high" (picture up,
words across its bottom edge) or "PHOTO_FRAME.low" (picture down, words across its top edge) -- the plan says
which, and they alternate across videos:
  <Img src={staticFile("library/<the plan's photo>")}
       style={{ position: "absolute", top: F.top, left: PHOTO_FRAME.left, width: PHOTO_FRAME.width,
                height: F.height, objectFit: "cover" }} />
(import { Img, staticFile } from "remotion"). The words go in the guide's headline boxes, stacked and centred,
crossing that edge: about a third of the stack over the picture and the rest over the black, so for the bottom
edge the stack starts near F.bottom - 170, and for the top edge it ends near F.top + 170. Nothing else sits on
the picture, and the black around it stays empty.
Leave the photograph as it is -- no tint, blur, gradient or border -- and let it move slowly: a gentle scale from
1 to about 1.06 across the scene.

the logo (<Img src={LOGO_WHITE} /> on BLACK, LOGO_BLACK on WHITE), the takeaway -- "${script.takeaway}" -- and the
follow ask with HANDLE (@thebuyboxre).

Overflow safety: Archivo at weight 900 runs about 0.62 x fontSize per character, so characters x fontSize x 0.62
must fit SAFE_W (820px) or the element's own width. Wrap it (a maxWidth with normal wrapping) or size it down;
never let text run off-frame.

Plain labels: the viewer may be brand new to real estate investing. Every number or term on screen carries a short
everyday label that matches what the narration calls it (e.g. "Rent: $4,500 a month"), never a bare acronym and
never a label the narration does not use.

Transitions: TransitionSeries with slide() and wipe() only, each SWIPE long (the voiceover timing assumes that
overlap), directions varied, no two identical back to back.

Register the new composition in ${REMOTION_ROOT}/src/Root.tsx following its exact existing pattern
(a TOTAL_S constant summing scene seconds minus swipe overlaps, a new <Composition id="${PascalName.replace('Video','')}">).

BRAND CHECK: before rendering, run
  node ${REMOTION_ROOT}/brand-lint.mjs ${REMOTION_ROOT}/src/${PascalName}.tsx
Fix every problem it reports until it prints "brand check passed". It may also print notes: text a little outside the
safe zone. Those pass, and are fine where a scene needs the room to keep text from overlapping; don't use them as a
habit. It checks the rules above, never your layout.

Then render it: cd ${REMOTION_ROOT} && npx remotion render src/index.ts ${PascalName.replace('Video', '')} out/${research.slug}.mp4
Report the tsxPath, compositionId, whether the brand check passed, whether the initial render succeeded, any render
error text, and the list of scene durations in seconds you used (in beat order) -- Voiceover needs these as the
starting point.`,

SLUG = "${research.slug}" and LINES with the beats below, UNCHANGED (do not rewrite them -- the template
already handles making them TTS-safe). Do not skip the template's numeric_tts.spoken_text() import/usage
or its post-generation speedup step -- both are required, not optional:
- numeric_tts.spoken_text() spells out every number/currency/year/percent in the TTS input (on-screen
  captions in the .tsx can keep the compact numeric form, e.g. "$240,000" -- this only affects what's sent
  to the voice model). Also spell out any acronyms with periods yourself if a beat has one (e.g. "D.S.C.R."),
  and avoid "--" in lines -- use commas instead.
- the template generates at natural pace then applies a uniform speedup (SPEEDUP, 1.12) for a faster,
  more enthusiastic feel without per-word slurring, and already uses expressive delivery settings
  (STABILITY 0.2, STYLE 0.9) -- keep its defaults unless the change requested below is about the voice.${BRIEF.revision ? `

${revisionBlock()}
If that change is about how the narration sounds (more enthusiastic, more range, calmer, slower), make it

Steps:
1. Fill in and run voiceover_${research.slug}.py to get the real per-scene durations (already speedup-adjusted).
   It also writes ${REMOTION_ROOT}/public/${research.slug}/captions.json, the word timings the <Captions> overlay
   reads; check that file exists before step 3, because the re-render is what puts the captions in.
2. Apply those exact durations back into ${assembly.tsxPath} (each TransitionSeries.Sequence's s(...) call,
   in beat order) and the TOTAL_S constant in Root.tsx.
3. Re-render: npx remotion render src/index.ts ${assembly.compositionId} out/${research.slug}.mp4
4. Mux the SAME narration audio file (don't regenerate) onto the fresh render with ffmpeg (-c:v copy -map 0:v:0
   -map 1:a:0 -af apad -c:a aac -shortest) to out/${research.slug}_voice.mp4. Keep the apad: the video runs
   a couple of seconds past the last line on purpose, and a plain -shortest cuts that closing hold off.
