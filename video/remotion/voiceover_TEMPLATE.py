"""
CANONICAL voiceover template -- copy this file to voiceover_<slug>.py for a
new video and fill in LINES. This is the reference the pipeline workflow's
Voiceover stage is told to follow.

Same timestamp-driven approach as every video so far: generate ONE
continuous take via ElevenLabs' with-timestamps endpoint, find each line's
real start time via character alignment, then compute the Remotion scene
durations that make the VIDEO match the VOICE (video timed to voice, never
the other way around).

Two things this template adds over earlier one-off scripts:
1. Numbers are spelled out for the TTS input via numeric_tts.spoken_text()
   -- on-screen captions can keep the compact numeric form ($240,000), but
   raw digits sent to the voice model get mispronounced inconsistently.
2. Voice is generated at natural pace (so it's not slurred/rushed the way
   ElevenLabs' own speed parameter makes it), then uniformly time-stretched
   with ffmpeg's atempo AFTER generation for a faster, more energetic feel
   -- all timestamps are rescaled by the same factor so sync is unaffected.

Run from newsletter_video_pipeline/remotion/:  python voiceover_<slug>.py
Then apply the printed durationInFrames values to <Slug>Video.tsx and the
printed TOTAL_S to Root.tsx, re-render, and re-run this script -- it will
mux the same audio it already generated onto the fresh render.
