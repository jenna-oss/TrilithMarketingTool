# The corpora, for agents

Three bodies of text live in Postgres, each behind one retrieval function. An
agent answering a question should query these rather than be handed a corpus in
a prompt.

| Schema    | What it holds                                    | Entry point                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `adspy`   | 781 competitor ads, 256 advertisers               | `adspy.search_ads`           |
| `content` | 37 Trilith pages, 254 passages                    | `content.search_content`     |
| `adspy`   | 317 hook/USP patterns from 7 outside advertisers   | `adspy.search_hook_patterns` |

The first two answer *what to say*: what competitors are saying, and what
Trilith has already said. The third answers *what shape to say it in*, and is
the only one not sourced from the lending category — read its caveats before
using it.

# Competitor ads — `adspy`

## One function

```sql
select * from adspy.search_ads(
  q             => 'no income verification',  -- relevance search over ad copy
  advertiser    => 'kiavi',                   -- fuzzy, partial names are fine
  product       => 'dscr',                    -- dscr | fix-and-flip | bridge |
                                              -- ground-up | portfolio | brrrr |
                                              -- multifamily
  audience      => 'broker',                  -- broker | borrower
  seen_since    => '2026-08-01',              -- when *we* first saw it
  started_since => '2026-08-01',              -- when Meta says it launched
  max_rows      => 40                         -- capped at 500
);
```

Every argument is optional. Omit `q` and it becomes a filtered browse with
`relevance` returned as 0. Supply `q` and it matches on **any** query term, so a
natural-language question still returns something, then ranks ads carrying every
term above ads carrying one. A word-similarity fallback catches misspellings.

Each row carries an `ad_library_url` pointing at the live ad on Meta, so an
agent can cite the primary source instead of asking the reader to take its word.

Over PostgREST the same function is `public.adspy_search_ads` — the `adspy`
schema itself is not exposed.

## Roster

```sql
select * from adspy.advertiser_summary order by ad_count desc;
select name, fb_page_id from adspy.advertisers where is_tracked;
```

18 lenders are under deliberate daily watch. Seven of them have zero ads, and
that is data, not a gap — CoreVest and Anchor Loans run nothing on Meta despite
their size. The remaining 231 advertisers surfaced through keyword sweeps.

## Two things the data will not tell you

**`started` is not `first_seen`.** `started` is Meta's launch date; `first_seen`
is the day our sweep first observed the ad. Only `first_seen` supports a claim
like "new this week", and even then the baseline sweep of 2026-08-15 has to be
excluded, because everything running that day shares that date without being new.

**Ad count is not spend.** A lender running 114 creatives is not outspending one
running 33. The Ad Library reports creatives, never budget.

---

# Hook patterns — `adspy.hook_patterns`

317 searchable creative structures from seven advertisers outside the lending
category, via the Spyglass API. `HOOK` is how a piece opens; `USP` is the claim
it leads with.

Two volume-ish fields, and they are not the same thing:

- **`total`** — times the pattern was used. Only on the 59 rows seeded from the
  Spyglass MCP surface; the REST endpoint does not report it, so it is null
  elsewhere. Null means *unknown*, never zero, and `min_total` skips those rows
  rather than dropping them.
- **`weeks_active`** — weekly buckets the pattern appeared in, from the API. A
  hook running every week for two months is a different signal from one that
  spiked once.

| Brand | Category | Searchable | Why it is here |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| Alex Hormozi | Business education | 87 | Operator and broker voice, offer framing |
| NerdWallet | Consumer finance | 67 | Money anxiety, comparison, regret framing |
| Zillow | Real estate | 52 | Property decisions, agent authority |
| Chime | Consumer finance | 48 | Fast-benefit and challenge openers |
| LendingTree | Consumer finance | 27 | Rate comparison and refinance structure |
| Robert Kiyosaki | Finance education | 22 | Contrarian macro and asset framing |
| Rocket Money | Consumer finance | 14 | Hidden-cost and confession openers |

```sql
select * from adspy.search_hook_patterns(
  q            => 'rate comparison refinance savings',
  insight_type => 'HOOK',        -- HOOK | USP
  brand        => 'lendingtree',
  min_total    => 10,            -- only patterns used at least this often
  max_rows     => 25
);
```

**These brands are not Trilith competitors, and this is not competitor
intelligence.** Spyglass has no insight coverage for investor lenders at all —
Kiavi, Lima One and the rest return empty, the same ceiling the Meta sweep hit.
What it offers is *form*: the shape a piece of creative takes, abstracted into
something reusable. Substance has to come from the ad corpus or Trilith's own
writing. The agent is instructed never to claim a competitor uses a hook on the
strength of this table, and to say plainly when it is adapting a form from
outside the category.

`percent_delta` is Spyglass's own change figure against the previous window.
Negative means the brand is leaning on that pattern less than it was.

## Refreshing it

`.github/workflows/weekly-hook-patterns.yml`, Mondays 12:00 UTC.
`tools/pull-spyglass.mjs` calls `GET /brands/{id}/insights` on
`https://app.spyglass.so/api/v1` for a pinned brand list;
`tools/push-hook-patterns.mjs` sends the result through `hook_patterns_upsert`.
Needs `SPYGLASS_API_KEY` as a repository secret, alongside the two Supabase
ones. Both scripts skip themselves, without failing, when their secret is
absent.

Three deliberate choices, all driven by Spyglass billing **credits per row
returned**:

- **Weekly, not daily.** Creative structure moves far more slowly than ad
  inventory. Seven brands x two insight types is fourteen calls a week.
- **Not a live agent tool.** Wiring Spyglass into the agent directly would spend
  credits on every question anyone asks, with no ceiling. The agent reads the
  Postgres copy instead.
- **Brand ids are pinned, not re-searched.** Re-resolving names each run would
  spend credits rediscovering ids that never change, and risks latching onto a
  different brand when a name is ambiguous.

Only `HOOK` and `USP` are pulled. `TARGET_PERSONA` and `MEDIA_MIX` exist and
answer a different question; add them to `TYPES` in the harvester if you want
them, and expect the credit cost to rise accordingly.

### Muting instead of deleting

The scheduled refresh loads whatever the API returns, which will include the
creator-content noise that was filtered by hand on the first load. Rather than
re-delete those rows every week, set `muted = true`:

```sql
update adspy.hook_patterns set muted = true
where brand_id = '7129388593' and label ilike '%astrology%';
```

Muted rows are excluded from search and the refresh never clears the flag, so
the judgement survives and stays visible instead of being reapplied by hand.

91 of the 408 rows are muted and excluded from search:

- **80 superseded paraphrases.** The first load was by hand and some labels were
  shortened in the process, so the API's verbatim versions arrived as new rows
  beside them. The paraphrase is muted, not deleted, because it carries a
  `total` the API cannot supply.
- **11 creator-content artifacts** — astrology aesthetics, a Santa persona, song
  lyrics, a Game Boy reaction, AI-clone hooks specific to Hormozi's own product.
  These were filtered by hand on the first load and the refresh pulled them back
  in, which is exactly why muting exists.

Brands considered and skipped: Airbnb (traveller-facing, not host-facing),
Robinhood and Acorns (retail-trading psychology, further from the audience than
what is already loaded). Kiavi, Lima One and every other investor lender return
empty and cannot be added.

# Trilith's own content — `content`

37 pages: 22 blog posts, 4 funded-deal writeups, 6 product pages, the FAQ and
the rest. Split into 254 passages, because the unit of retrieval is the passage,
not the article — a post runs a thousand words and an agent wants the paragraph
that answers its question.

```sql
select * from content.search_content(
  q        => 'appraisal comes in low',   -- passage-level relevance search
  kind     => 'blog',                     -- blog | case-study | product | faq | page
  since    => '2026-06-01',               -- published on or after
  until    => '2026-08-01',
  max_rows => 20                          -- capped at 200
);
```

Each row returns the full `passage` plus a `snippet` with matched terms wrapped
in `**`, so an agent can judge relevance before reading the whole thing, and the
`url` and `title` to cite. When a passage is not enough:

```sql
select * from content.get_document('/blog/fix-and-flip-math');   -- full body
select * from content.document_index order by published desc;    -- coverage map
```

Over PostgREST the search is `public.content_search`.

## How ranking works, and where it is weak

Matching is OR across query terms for recall. Ranking then combines inverse
document frequency (rare terms count for more), term proximity, a bonus for
passages carrying every term, and a bonus for a hit in the heading — headings are
where these posts state their arguments.

The weak spot is worth knowing: the corpus is small and topically narrow, so IDF
misjudges domain vocabulary. "Appraisal" appears in 34 of 254 passages and
"low" in 12, which makes the retriever treat *low* as the rarer, more meaningful
word. Proximity is what rescues the ranking there. Expect the same effect for any
term central to lending — DSCR, bridge, rehab — and lean on `kind` and date
filters when a query is built entirely from house vocabulary.

## Two things the content data will not tell you

**Only blog posts have publisher-stated dates.** `date_source` says where a date
came from: `json-ld` means Trilith stated it, `sitemap-lastmod` means it was
inferred from a file timestamp. Product pages have no date at all — every static
page shares one sitemap timestamp, which is the site build stamp, and the
harvester discards it rather than presenting a build as a publication.

**No author is recorded**, because the site's structured data does not name one.

---

## Keeping it current

Both corpora refresh from the same daily job.

**Ads.** `tools/to-sql.mjs` shapes `data/ads.json` into `data/ads-load.json`,
deriving `product_lines` and `audience` from the copy — those rules live there
and nowhere else. `tools/push-supabase.mjs` sends it through the
`adspy_upsert_ads` RPC, which owns the merge: `first_seen` is never overwritten
and `last_seen` only moves forward.

**Content.** `tools/pull-content.mjs` walks the sitemap and re-chunks every
page into `data/content.json`. `tools/push-content.mjs` sends it through
`content_upsert_docs`, which upserts each document by URL and replaces its
chunks wholesale — chunk boundaries move whenever a post is edited or the
chunker changes, so ordinals cannot be merged in place.

The content steps are marked `continue-on-error`: Trilith's writing changes
slowly and can be re-harvested tomorrow, but a missed ad sweep is gone for good,
so a site hiccup must not take the ad pull down with it.

Both push steps need `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` as
repository secrets and skip themselves, without failing, when those are absent.
The service key bypasses RLS — it belongs in secrets and nowhere else.

## The agent

`ideas.html` is the single page. It answers questions about the category and
proposes content, talking to the `/ideas` route on the Worker, which gives the
model five tools rather than a corpus:

| Tool                     | Backed by                    |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `search_competitor_ads`  | `public.adspy_search_ads`    |
| `count_ads`              | `public.adspy_count_ads`     |
| `search_trilith_content` | `public.content_search`      |
| `search_hook_patterns`   | `public.hook_patterns_search` |
| `trilith_coverage`       | `public.content_coverage`    |

It runs up to six rounds of searching before answering, and streams every
search it makes to the page as it goes — an idea claiming a gap in the market
is only worth anything if you can see the query behind it.

### Why `count_ads` exists

There was a second page, `ask.html`, that answered questions by putting the
whole ad corpus — ~135K tokens — in a cached system prompt, rewritten whenever
the cache lapsed. Retrieval replaced it, and `ask.html` is now a redirect.

The one thing that design did better was exhaustive counting: it saw every ad
at once, where a search returns 40. `count_ads` restores that property and
improves on it — the count is computed by Postgres over every row, so it is
exact rather than a model tallying text, and it costs a few hundred tokens. The
system prompt tells the agent that counting search results undercounts and that
any "how many" question must go through this tool.

The Worker reads Supabase with the **anon** key, so this route physically
cannot write to either corpus. The system prompt carries the same caveats
recorded here: ad count is not spend, `started` is not `first_seen`, absence
from the corpus is not absence from the market, and a `sitemap-lastmod` date is
not a publication date.

Deploy:

```
cd worker && npm install
npx wrangler secret put ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
npx wrangler secret put SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
npx wrangler deploy
```

Then set `WORKER_URL` at the top of the script in `ideas.html`. The page shows
setup instructions and disables its input until it is set.

## Security

Neither `adspy` nor `content` is exposed over PostgREST. Four wrappers in
`public` are the only doors:

| Function                      | Who can call it |
| ----------------------------- | --------------- |
| `public.adspy_search_ads`     | anon, authenticated, service_role |
| `public.content_search`       | anon, authenticated, service_role |
| `public.adspy_count_ads`      | anon, authenticated, service_role |
| `public.hook_patterns_search` | anon, authenticated, service_role |
| `public.adspy_upsert_ads`     | service_role only |
| `public.content_upsert_docs`  | service_role only |

The read wrappers run as `SECURITY INVOKER`, so the RLS policies on the
underlying tables stay in the path. The write wrappers are `SECURITY DEFINER`
and have `EXECUTE` revoked from `public`, `anon` and `authenticated` — a definer
function callable by anon would let anyone rewrite either corpus.

## On embeddings

There is no vector column on either corpus. At 774 ads and 254 passages,
full-text with IDF and proximity ranking answers the questions being asked, and
`pgvector` would add a third-party embedding dependency (Anthropic provides no
embeddings API) for corpora this size. Both schemas leave room to add one later;
nothing here assumes it.

Revisit that for the content corpus first — it is the one where a question can
be phrased with none of the words the passage uses, which is exactly what
keyword retrieval cannot fix.
